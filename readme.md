# Machination

> An application for orchestrating tabletop RPGs that require comprehensive battle maps.

Machination is an application designed in the spirit of Roll20, providing utilities for running tabletop RPG campaigns, especially those like DnD4e that have complex combat systems.  Unlike Roll20, it is intended to service target tabletop systems at a lower level, automating much of the tiresome bookkeeping.
